Quickstart

## How to:
- In the console:
```
git clone --recursive {this repo url} {new project name}
cd {project name}/libJDubX/

```
- Move the files in gdx-game/src/example and gdx-game-android/src/example to your own package
- In each of those files, change the example packages and names accordingly
- In the androidmanifest, change the package, version, and/or orientations
- Take over Example.java

git remote set-url origin {new repo url}
git push
```
